## To use a default value for one of the parameter of I-Race, you
## should simply not specify this parameter (comment it in this file,
## and do not give any value on the command line).

## File that contains the description of the parameters.
parameterFile <- "path/to/parameters.txt"

## Directory where the programs will be run.
#execDir <- "./runner"

## File (if relative path, relative to execDir) to save tuning 
## results as an R dataset.
logFile <- "./irace.Rdata"

## Folder where tuning instances are located, either absolute or
## relative to execDir.
trainInstancesDir <- "path/to/QAPtraininginstances"

## File with a list of instances and (optionally) parameters.
## If empty or NULL, does not use a file.
trainInstancesFile <- "path/to/instances.txt"

## A file containing a list of initial candidates. 
## If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# candidatesFile <- "candidates.txt"

## The script called for each candidate that
## launches the program to be tuned. See templates/.
targetRunner <- "target-runner"

## The scrip that provides a numeric value for each
## candidate. See templates/.
# targetEvaluator  <- "target-evaluator.tmpl"

## Experiment name for output report.
# expName  <- "Experiment Name"
expName <- "qapes"

## Longer experiment description for output report.
# expDescription <- "Experiment Description"

## The maximum number of runs (invocations of hookRun) that will performed. It
## determines the (maximum) budget of experiments for the tuning, unless
## timeBudget is positive.
maxExperiments <- 10000

## The maximum computation time that should be used for tuning in
## seconds. This only works when tuning for time. 0 means no time
## limit (use maxExperiments).
#timeBudget <- 0

## An estimation of the average time in seconds required for one
## experiment. Only required if timeBudget is positive.
#timeEstimate <- 0

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
digits <- 4

## A value of 0 silences all debug messages. Higher values provide
## more verbose debug messages.
debugLevel <- 0

## Number of iterations of Race. Do not use something else than the
## default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly what
## you are doing.
# nbIterations <- 0

## Number of experiments per iteration. Do no use something else than
## the default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly
## what you are doing.
# nbExperimentsPerIteration <- 0

## Sample the instances or take them always in the same order.
# sampleInstances <- 1

## Specifies the statistical test type: F-test or t-test.
testType <- "t-test"

## Specifies after how many instances are seen before the first test
## is performed.
firstTest <- 5

## Specifies after how many instances are seen before each test after
## the first one is performed.
eachTest <- 1

## The minimum number of candidates that should survive to continue one
## iteration. Do not use something else than the default (that is, the
## dynamic value) unless you know exactly what you are doing.
# minNbSurvival <- 0

## The number of candidates that should be sampled and evaluated at
## each iteration. Do no use something else than
## the default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly
## what you are doing.
# nbCandidates  <- 0

## This value is used to determine the number of candidates
## to be sampled and evaluated at each iteration. Use
## the default unless you know exactly what you are doing.
# mu <- 5

## Seed of the random number generator (must be a positive integer, NA
## means use a random seed).
# seed <- NA

## Number of calls to hookRun to execute in parallel. Less than 2
# means calls to hookRun are sequentially executed.
# parallel <- 0

## Enable/disable SGE cluster mode. Use qstat to wait for
## cluster jobs to finish (hookRun must invoke qsub).
# sgeCluster <- 0

## Enable/disable MPI. Use MPI to execute hookRun in parallel
## (parameter parallel is the number of slaves).
# mpi <- 0

## Enable/disable a soft restart strategy to avoid premature convergence 
## of the probabilistic model.
# softRestart <- 1
