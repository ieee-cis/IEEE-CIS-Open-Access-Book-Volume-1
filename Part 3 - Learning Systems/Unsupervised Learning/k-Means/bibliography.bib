speed and its simplicity. Until recently, however, no meaningful theoretical bounds
were known on its running time. In this paper, we demonstrate that the worst-case
running time of k-means is superpolynomial by improving the best known lower bound
from Ω(n) iterations to 2Ω(√n).},

abstract = {K-means is undoubtedly the most widely used partitional clustering algorithm. Unfortunately, due to its gradient descent nature, this algorithm is highly sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster centers. Numerous initialization methods have been proposed to address this problem. In this paper, we first present an overview of these methods with an emphasis on their computational efficiency. We then compare eight commonly used linear time complexity initialization methods on a large and diverse collection of data sets using various performance criteria. Finally, we analyze the experimental results using non-parametric statistical tests and provide recommendations for practitioners. We demonstrate that popular initialization methods often perform poorly and that there are in fact strong alternatives to these methods.}

Evolutionary genetic theory predicts that in the bacterial world, each sequence similarity cluster should correspond to an ecologically distinct population. Indeed, surveys of sequence diversity in protein-coding genes show that sequence clusters correspond to ecological populations. Future population surveys of protein-coding gene sequences can be expected to disclose many previously unknown ecological populations of bacteria. Sequence similarity clustering in protein-coding genes is recommended as a primary criterion for demarcating taxa.",
